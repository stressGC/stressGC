			<p class="text-lg text-offwhite">
				In my current role as a Staff Lead Software Engineer at Phantombuster, I lead a product squad in
				building innovative and user-centric software solutions, all while advocating for and implementing
				Software Craftsmanship practices in our day-to-day work.
			</p>
			<p class="text-lg mt-2 text-offwhite">
				I am well-versed in various domains including AI, blockchain, and web automation. Having worked in
				French and English-speaking environments, I am adept at collaborating effectively with diverse, global
				teams in remote-first environments.

			<h2 class="font-semibold text-xl mt-4 mb-2 text-cyan">Skills</h2>
			<p class="text-lg text-offwhite">
				My skillset spans gathering user needs, mentoring teams, architecturing systems, handling both frontend
				and backend development, managing tooling, and overseeing infrastructure. A key aspect of my work
				includes ensuring system observability, performance monitoring, and maintenance. Although I currently
				work with Typescript, React, and Node, I'm always ready to learn and adapt to the best technologies for
				the job.
